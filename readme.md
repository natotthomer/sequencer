## Sequencer

For now, it's just a simple metronome, but around that core functionality, I will be writing an analog-style step sequencer.

## Motivation

This is a proof of concept, intended to eventually be wrapped into a larger Javascript synthesizer project. Furthermore, it's an attempt at bridging the excellent A Tale of Two Clocks tutorial with [React](https://reactjs.org/) & the [WAAClock library](https://github.com/sebpiq/WAAClock)

## Installation

`cd` into folder
`npm install`

and then

`npm build` to clear `node_modules` folder and rebuild

or

`npm start` to rebuild bundle

open `index.html`
